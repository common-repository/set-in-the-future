=== Set in the Future ===
Contributors: terranrich
Requires at least: 4.6
Tested up to: 4.6.1

Allows you to alter the display of all of your posts (and pages) so they appear to be set into the future (e.g. 2364 instead of 2016)

== Description ==
Allows you to alter the display of all of your posts (and pages) so they appear to be set into the future. So, instead of "September 26, 2016", it could say "September 26, 2246" (but still be stored at 2016). This is a cosmetic alteration only, and does not affect the data (i.e. how the page is stored). This is perfect for fictitious blogs set in the future (especially sci-fi blogs from the perspective of a futuristic, fictional character)!

== Installation ==
Just plop this into your wp-content/plugins directory and activate it from the admin panel. Easy as that!
